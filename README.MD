# The Big List of Everything

This is a simple CRUD application using Rails and React.  The idea is to keep a comprehensive database of lists with pictures.  Problem: Some times you know what something looks like but don't know what it's called; but all you get from google is a few articles, pictures with no words, and loads of shopping ads.
